# hotelmanagementsystem-
In INT 219 I had opted a topic named as hotel  management system . In hotel management system I had  created 4 pages . One is of Login page . the visitors who  had came to our hotel we would be giving a id and  password so if they will visit again then they can get  some offers through log in page .second one is home  page .the visitors who need to book room in online they  can book their room through home page and the people  who came to our hotel their bookings also will be done  in online itself .This page consist of both room and food  service page.If anyone opt both room and food at a time  then they can have a offer of 30%. Third page is only  room booking page, fourth page is car booking .the  visitors who came to our hotel they had given the access  to book a car from dropping or pickings. Fifth page is  feedback page . In this page the customers can mention  their feedbacks of room service, food service and car service
